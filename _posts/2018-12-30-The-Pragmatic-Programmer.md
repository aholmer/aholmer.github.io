title: The Pragmatic Programmer
---

This first book is a book about developing, and is to be 
[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19862709-the-pragmatic-programmer).

The book compliment its title with the subtitle "From journeyman to master", in an attempt to imprint the notion on the reader, that programming is a craft. I happen to agree, as I see major similarities on how a mason, through experience, is able to wwork faster, more precise, and doing more correct moves. In the same way, a developer is able to increase efficiency, and with the knowledge about design patterns or common problems, be able to quickly come up with a reusable solution.

You quickly realise this book is not modern. It is in fact almost 20 years old, as of this writing, and it is quite clear that some some concepts and ideas have changed in the last two decades. Unfortunately for the book, it is in strong need of a review for me to really recommend it. 

Instead I would encourage a reader to grab a copy of [Clean Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code), which is a modern, practical, and in a lot of ways "pragmatic".
